## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### What This System Does

‚úÖ **Generates authentic-sounding content** that reads like it was written by a real person with experience
‚úÖ **Eliminates AI artifacts** (phrases like "delve into," "testament to," overuse of em-dashes)
‚úÖ **Ensures fact-checking** with built-in verification protocols
‚úÖ **Maintains consistency** across multiple articles while avoiding repetition
‚úÖ **Saves time** by getting you 80-90% to finished product

### What This System Requires

üìå **Quality research inputs** - Garbage in, garbage out. Spend time on research.
üìå **Human editing** - AI gets you most of the way; humans add the final polish
üìå **Fact verification** - Always verify claims before publishing
üìå **Iterative refinement** - Prompts improve as you customize them for your needs

### What This System Doesn't Do

‚ùå Generate completely finished articles with zero editing
‚ùå Conduct original research (you provide the research notes)
‚ùå Replace human judgment on tone and style
‚ùå Guarantee 100% originality without human review

- **Tier 2 (Supporting):** Claims and comparisons - verify or remove
- **Tier 3 (Qualitative):** General patterns - verify basis or attribute

**Result:** Trustworthy, accurate content

### 3. Style Consistency

Templates include:
- Tone directives
- Voice requirements
- Structural frameworks
- Example good/bad content

**Result:** Professional consistency across all articles

### 4. Customization Framework
